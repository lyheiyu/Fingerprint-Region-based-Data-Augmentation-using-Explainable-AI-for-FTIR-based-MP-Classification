# FRDA: Fingerprint Region based Data Augmentation using Explainable AI for FTIR based Microplastic Classification
This is for the trained Machine learning model of SVM.
You can use it directly or trained from other python file.

## # FRDA
In this algorithmï¼Œ there are 3 MP dataset, so you can find in 3 py file for different dataset augmenting.
